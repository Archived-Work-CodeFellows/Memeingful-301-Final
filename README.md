# Meme-ingful

A web application that uses RESTful APIs to create a fun and meme-ingful experience for any occasion.

# Technologies:

Our backend is built off of Node Express. It serves as a controller that will make requests to our two APIs in this project. One being the Bing Image Search API and the other being a quote API from [theysaidso.com](https://theysaidso.com/).

Our frontend is built using HTML5, CSS and Javascript with Handlebars for templating and jQuery for DOM manipulation. We are also utilizing PageJS to make this a Single Page App and it is currently deployed live on heroku.com

# Instructions:

To get started, after you download the code you will need to head over and get both an API key from the azure services with Microsoft and a key for theysaidso. We are using a paid version of theysaidso so your immediate results will vary. 

We recommend dotenv and nodemon as Node packages to help streamline your interaction. dotenv module will allow you to set environment variables so you do not have to keep resetting them in your terminal's instance and nodemon is similar to running a file with node but will restart if it detects changes within your server file.

You can see it deployed [here](https://memeingful.herokuapp.com/).
